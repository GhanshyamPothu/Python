# 📊 Business Data Analysis using Python (Pandas & NumPy)

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates practical **data analysis and data manipulation** using Python. It focuses on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing multiple datasets to answer real-world business questions, simulating common Data Analyst tasks.

## ❓ Business Problem
Organizations often store data across multiple files and formats, making it difficult to analyze employee performance, financial metrics, and project status in one view.  
This project focuses on cleaning, merging, and transforming raw datasets to create analysis-ready data for business decision-making.

## 🧠 Analysis Tasks & Approach
- Loaded and explored multiple CSV datasets
- Handled missing values using appropriate business logic
- Cleaned and transformed raw data for analysis
- Split and standardized text-based columns
- Merged multiple datasets using joins
- Created new calculated and derived columns
- Applied conditional logic to generate insights
- Prepared structured datasets ready for reporting and further analysis

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
